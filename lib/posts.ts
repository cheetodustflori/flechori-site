I catch Summer like a flu:

an early onset of dewy mornings

drizzled over migraines, cooled by the
speckled shadows of birds swarming 

toward northern winds. May weaves a spread of
swallows’ cries homeward and suddenly

I am eleven for a moment, unknowingly leaking
my guts onto the sidewalk. When I turn, the

the heel of my shoe smears a crimson
crescent across pavement. 

There: girlhood as a red dot on shoelaces. 
Reminded I filled a bus with metallic scents of

childhood, pungent with dirty, tile floors
and teeth bursting from gums; this

is the proof I need that I can still
bleed from my cuts and not cry. Get up. I am

stronger than I was when I was six,
pinching and biting so someone else’s

flesh might be infected with my
type of Summer: humidity in a

space between fingers, some tired cicada
drumming into the creases of

a folding palm and the crack of
chalk against sidewalk inside my

head, dragging. I didn’t understand why people
weren’t as ill as I was with lonely nights,

watching the car pull out of the driveway
again. Again. Again I am

left alone to wipe my sweat against

the wall. Beyond peeling paint we are
separated from Mom’s loneliness the way 

December is from Tuesdays. Seven years ago
we were still in the community center,

driven into a cool basement while
sunset in June melodied herself outside.

Newly sharpened stars sliced into
pulsing indigo. Summer cries, too, when she

hurts herself, but quietly; in the form of
burnt wood, billowing into her face

and staining the air. There’s an art to
picking ourselves apart in silence, and

she knows it best. Every year sickness returns
to remind me that I am alone,

with myself, losing crimson in
bite-sized pints each full moon.

I am off the road, shouldering
the world, shrugging off

eighteen and shedding skin from
seventeen until I am fevered

and thirteen again.`.trim(),

Take a look at this photo
It’s me and you
Side-by-side
Shouldering the weight of
a new atmosphere too
big to feel and us:
four years into sinking under its
crushing force 
And perceiving only each other
as the cornerstone of existence 

Today, you cut your finger on
the edge of a book, and a piece
of that picture leaked out of your
thumb: snot-nosed, mouth wide,
and eyes terrified by the sight of
the world. She became a stain
on the couch, a permanent mark
of childhood.

When you wrapped a band aid
around the wound, there was a
flash of pain around your mouth. The
wince etched into your cheeks
became a familiar portrait. She
was round with gentle care and 
spoiled by the moon. Caressed
Gently each night by some familiar
hand and cradled in the bosom
of innocence.

But she slipped away as quickly as she came.
And the light poured in through
Your eyes—once yours, now replaced
with the lens of some bigger figure.
A high and mighty man whose
voice never trembles. A trombone
That condemns fear. Some shard
from the viewing glass our old man 
left behind.

And so we move, slowly. Patching
ourselves with the remnants
around us. Tea bags for gashes
and sunlight for bruised feet. Taking
a piece of the world and shedding
away that photograph beneath an
imperfect gauze; I’ll take your
loose tooth and force it into an open
pocket inside my gums,

Even if my body rejects it. I take
my souvenirs seriously. 

It’s natural. To lose that picture
of ourselves each time the earth
pinches us too tight—and to stop
the leak with some loose end.
Undoing and becoming. Stuffing
the scarecrow. Embracing the wind.
Knowing every hair lost is a
light gained

A light which casts darker shadows 
behind trinkets we gather
below our pumping hearts

My compassion curls when this
blade snaps into the board. Zest stings
stale air around a ripened orange. My
affection is rugged skin
on a loose peel— pink flesh cowers beneath.
 
I am quick to anger, faster to lunge, tender
when spoken to but sick of some words 
too foreign to stomach

it is 12:30 am and I will hear a spread of tears burst
into a heaving cry down the hallway, shadowed by
rainfall dripping shamefully from sprinklers outside the window. A muffled anguish is
near but my heart is distant. someone is breaking, and I am peeved. citrus pink
wafts out into an open space where someone
can taste acid in the wind. 

tighten your grip on the handle, but I’ve let it loose. My sweetness fades
eventually and everyone’s tongue folds
at its tartness. Their eyes
squeeze shut and I am ripped from their world.
The slice has gone bad.

Turn my body
and press its wound face-down. Let
crimson drip past the edge of the board, wetting the ground, nestling in hiding.

There’s a new face to view; red glows
orange in sunlight. My decay
Shrivels away from view. Bitterness placated.

Never mind the rotten heart beneath
the glow. Out of sight, breeding in the mind.
Holding space in the gut. Planting its seed. 

Making a home.

Of bristles tuning noise when 
scrutiny settles between tendril
and tendril  Of dents sunk into
earth-crust, bronze between

two peaks greening a thousand
mouths silently chipping away at
walls toward destination and where 
was theirs? Mine lay under the skin

Of West Coast sun, nestled itself in
flesh, opened up the mouth for more
time—Counts ticks with two hands 
weaving through dirt Of hair-stalks 

pouring shade over peeling  Crimson
gone blue and the buck lifts his 
burnt head, knowing before he feels

Juvenile, the way lips wet the knuckle, 
how beak and feather fetch laughter from my

pit, when the weight of legs are no longer
freeing. It must be youth that purloins woe

from my pores, folding skin over into a page 
of names. Finger to cheek and, foreign to my

own texture, I mistake feeling for touching. 
A dip above the jaw reminds me of a greeting

departed into absence; vowels trickle into open
air, riding the draft of a breath and a half until

pavement bites mouth. Goodbye becomes native
tongue, making loss the easiest part of remembrance 

because when sunset tucks her legs onto the 
highway, I admit I don’t miss the sound of anything, 

I loathe the creases. Endless: remains flaked onto 
a scalp of tendrils and stalks of childhood, time

for embrace, bracing for the time my hands grasp 
an absent body. Let me tell you a story of recovery. 

Mother melted gold into my ears each night,
our pores would overflow in the morning onto

tile floors. Once noon hit kitchen counter, her hands, 
blistered red, would collect the aureate into a sigh.

This is not the space for me. This is
hands wet, feet marooned, back bent

into obedience. Have you been listening
to the news? Anchors in blue depths

told me Pluto brings back news from its 
banishment, and humanity only sighs 

at discovery: what a shame this is
tile floors gone cold, twilight absence,

the silence between greeting and
parted lips, fingers made for plucking

evidence of intimacy from gums 
discarding affection into the barrels of 

guns to be shot into the black of ribs. 
Tuck your hands, then I will know this is 

when I barter for the lining of oak trees —
thirty cents for a bit of your skin, mister, but 

do not question me when I lift my eyes to 
redwood, my grace drifting towards how 

aching bulges outwards and sinks into itself, 
pulsing to the breath of wet wind. Watch 

bark fold hands into innocence in the 
shape of feathers crimsoned by sight, and 

realize that I, too, once gained from loss. 
From behind the ivory bars of a bird cage, 

remind me of what this is.

fell onto the earth and 
split his head wide open 
so the world could peer 
inside to grieve. 

What a shame that his 
face is shaped in a way 
that makes his reflection 
unravel counterclockwise.

The outcast child has guts 
where his molars should be. 
His throat is a single, pincer-
lined pipe to the stomach: 

a pit holding his decay 
and a foreign set of teeth.
The children pinch his red-
tinted skin and pull at the 

nibs that once were his ears. 
Roach boy. Tick eater. Ant 
Killer. In embrace of their 
taunts, he splits his lips to 

reveal a blackened mound 
of eyes. To him, his diet is 
only natural. He’s spent his 
life consuming everything 

that hurts him: scabs, hang-
nails, the hand that struck 
him. The first time he bled, 
a mosquito had bitten his 

earlobe. It stings, he thought, 
and spent the night pulling at 
the skin until a rose bloomed 
on his pillow case.

but I remember the texture of its curling and the duration of its punishment. Tearing off the bark of a tree would emit a whimper, and driving became a chorus of wails from concrete pores. I had never yearned for silence until my father leapt into it embraced by the roar of his engine. Slipping under the scene of scattered metal was a faintly-volumed sipping: blades of grass consuming his crimson. Nature was taking us back, and I could only witness her hunger. 

Sister, break my bread for me. I don’t sleep anymore. Instead, I walk. My feet drag callouses into the soil as I listen my way into the heart of the forest, coveted by the appetite of shadows. Finding approval in my nature, a string of groans lures me into an opening in the thicket; the sun bleeds through holes in hanging indigo as a silver plate melts into the horizon. No space for pondering. I sink myself into its solution and let my pores widen for sound. She kisses my innards where they bruise and mimics the sensation of fullness. 

I have been spared from punishment. For now. She whispers to me of Parisian delicacies, thin limbs tasting of sweetness, and the emptiness inside her. I carry it between the lining of my stomach when I feign eating at the dinner table. Sister, when did you become so plump? Grinding rocks between molars for reprieve, I think I should give into silence as well, but I know she will not allow it. When the crust of the world breaks, I will be the last of its cravings.
